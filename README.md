>  I'm thrilled to announce that I've recently finished my first-ever game using HTML, CSS, and JS! It's an incredibly enjoyable breakout game that I'm genuinely proud of. I dedicated a significant amount of time and effort to its creation, and I sincerely hope that you'll have an absolute blast while playing it! So, get ready to pop those tiles and have a fantastic time!
